## MyReads One Page Web Application
 
My reads is a web application, that allows user to search for books and to categorize them. 
There are three categories/book shelves: Currently reading, Want to read and already read. 
User can add a book to a desired category.
The book can be added to a category from the main page or from the search bar.

## Why this project
This project is part of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program 
The project is built with React
Udacity provided with the basic code and design
My part was to create the right react components and to route them correctly in order to make the page fully working.
