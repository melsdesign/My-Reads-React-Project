## MyReads One Page Web Application
 
My Reads is a web application, that allows users to search for books and to categorize them. 
There are three categories/bookshelves: Currently reading, Want to read and already read. 
Users can add a book to a desired category.
The book can be added to a category from the main page or from the search bar.

## Why this project
This project is part of the Udacity Front End Nanodegree program 
The project is built with React
Udacity provided the basic code and design
My part was to create the right react components and to route them correctly in order to make the page fully working.

You can see the page live here: https://melsdesign.github.io/My-Reads-React-Project/

## Details:
->On the main page user can access from the drop-down arrow three categories, 
->Each book can be assigned to one of these categories, if none match then can be chosen "none" and the book will not be visible until it is searched again
->If a category is chosen the book will be assigned to it.
->User can select/change a book category on each page.
->User can navigate from the main page to the search page and back using the interface or forward and back buttons of the browser.
->Every book is displayed with a thumbnail, title and author's name if the information is available on the server.
